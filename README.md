# gsoc-progress
Google Summer of Code 2015 for DBpedia Spotlight. Some code and weekly summaries of my progress.

My project is outlined [here](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/pdowling/5700735861784576). I'll be adding support for advanced vector models to DBpedia Spotlight.

This repository will contain some code that results from the work I do, which doesn't directly go into the Spotlight codebase. I'll also write sone summaries of what tasks I work on each week and what the key results are.
